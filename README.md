# Project Overview

This is a example project of how i used Jasemine tests in my web application.
It demonstrates sync and async tests.

## Why testing?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.
